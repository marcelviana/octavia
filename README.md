## üß™ Tests

Automated unit tests live in `lib/__tests__` and are executed with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). Run `npm test` to execute them.

### Offline Support

The application includes an offline mode backed by IndexedDB. A health check endpoint (`/api/health`) lets the client detect when connectivity returns. Library data and setlists viewed while online are cached locally so they can be accessed from the dedicated offline page when the network is unavailable. Cached files are stored as binary Blobs and an LRU policy keeps the total size under 50‚ÄØMB to avoid quota errors. In addition to IndexedDB, a custom service worker caches key pages and static assets so previously visited screens load even without a network connection.

### Service Worker Updates

The service worker code lives in `worker/index.js`. A small build script copies this file to `public/sw.js` during `pnpm build`, ensuring the deployed worker always matches the source. When a new worker version is available, the app displays an update toast; clicking **Reload** activates the fresh worker immediately.

## üîß Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the variables listed in `.env.example`. These include Firebase credentials and the Supabase service role key required for server-side database access.
If you plan to enforce row level security, run the SQL in `supabase/rls-policies.sql` on your database.

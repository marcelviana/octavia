## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Visit the [live demo](https://vercel.com/marcelvianas-projects/v0-music-sheet-pro)
2. Click "Download Code" in the top right corner
3. Follow the shadcn CLI setup instructions

The `ALLOWED_PROXY_HOSTS` variable controls which domains the
offline cache proxy will fetch from. Add any additional hosts
you need for external imports (comma‚Äëseparated).

For server-side Firebase token validation, set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your site's
base URL (including `https://`). When deploying on Vercel you can rely on the
`VERCEL_URL` environment variable instead. These values are used to construct
the absolute URL for `/api/auth/verify`.

## üß™ Tests

Automated unit tests live in `lib/__tests__` and are executed with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). Run `npm test` to execute them.

### Offline Support

The application includes an offline mode backed by IndexedDB. A health check endpoint (`/api/health`) lets the client detect when connectivity returns. Library data and setlists viewed while online are cached locally so they can be accessed from the dedicated offline page when the network is unavailable. Cached files are stored as binary Blobs and an LRU policy keeps the total size under 50‚ÄØMB to avoid quota errors.
